# APIWallpaper
## A application that grabs a background from a website and sets it as a desktop wallpaper.

# How to use
## Create a file in "%localappdata%\Dexrn\APIWallpaper" called url.txt
## Then put a URL that has a raw image on it, when you run the application, it will set the image from the URL as your wallpaper.
## This works best with URLs that give you a random image on each load, or something similar.
